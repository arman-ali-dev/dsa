# Moore’s Voting Algorithm
Moore’s Voting Algorithm is used to find the majority element (the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times) in an array — in O(n) time and O(1) space.

## When to use:
Use this algorithm when:
  - You're guaranteed that a majority element exists
  - You want a constant space and linear time solution
