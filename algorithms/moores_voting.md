# Moore’s Voting Algorithm
Moore’s Voting Algorithm is used to find the majority element (the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times) in an array — in O(n) time and O(1) space.

## When to use:
Use this algorithm when:
  - You're guaranteed that a majority element exists
  - You want a constant space and linear time solution

## Example:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
<br/>
Output: 2
<br/>
<br/>
Explanation: 2 appears 4 times, which is more than n/2 = 3.5

### Time Complexity: O(n)
### Space Complexity: O(1)
